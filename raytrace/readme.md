# Rt Raytracer
A very basic raytracer for the `rt` data.

Thought it would be a fun project to spend a few hours on. The next steps for the CPU implementation would be to precompute as much as possible, put everything in a BVH, investigate cache, and make the `Camera` class easier to use.

Also, I intended to have a very basic GPU impl that just brute-force raycasted.
