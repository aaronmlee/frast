GDAL is great and all but it is not good for storing hierarchical data aligned to a certain coordinate system in a single file.
There is `gdal_grid.py`, but it requires a file per tile.

On top of that, the `[multiple tiffs] -> VRT -> gdalwarp -> gdalcalc -> gdaladdo` pipeline I find myself using to get a single tiff can take days to run on a 100'000Â² pixel AOI.

So this suite of several programs and one static library attempts to be better for the specific circumstance of storing many JPEG tiles into a single file at multiple levels under one projection.

It offers tools to convert from a GDAL supported format to an internal one (using gdal itself), and a library that amongst others, allows something equivalent to `RasterIO`.


### Dependencies
  - Eigen
  - LMDB
  - OpenCV 4+
  - Clang


# FrastVk Notes:
  - There is a big issue with my tree implementation for both `tiled_renderer2` and `rt`. It requires all children to close before closing the parent. This means that while rendering a deep level, a bunch out-of-frame but still high-res tiles must be resident.
  - The rocktree data includes an octant mask to help with, but I currently don't use it. Basically the vertices are organized in a way that allows rendering e.g. 3/8 tiles and not requiring having the sibiling still loaded. The parent can be partially rendered with the other 5/8 parts. This is a better approach.


### TODO
  - ~~Fix the bilinear interpolation in convertGdal.cc. It works when the number of sample points is large (128), but it should work for a very small grid too (like 4x4).~~
     - This was fixed by writing my own interpolation, see `my_remapRemap`
  - Allow resizing db when it grows too large, which also would not require inputting large enough size at creation time.
  - Support output to a cuda buffer.
  - ~~Support sampling an arbitrary quad (rather than just a bbox in rasterIo)~~, done, see `rasterIoQuad`
  - Explore if there is a benefit to exporting the lmdb to a completely flat read-only format, with a hashmap in the header that maps to file offsets of tiles.
  - Make convertGdal faster if input is already WebMercator (no need to warp)
